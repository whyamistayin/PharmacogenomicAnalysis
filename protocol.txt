Submitted files:
*.png - example visualization.
*.vcf - files containing alelles in each population.
*.bedGraph - files containing differences in alelle frequencies between nfe.vcf and others.
rs_dbsnp_joined.tsv - file that contains variants for analysis.
Makefile
collect_freqs_bg.py - file that computes differences and writes to *bedGraph.
collect_freqs_select.py - file that chooses only variants present in rs_dbsnp_joined.tsv fron stdin
and writes them into files splitting by population.
shrink_vcf.cpp - file that cuts all unnecessary information about variants to fit into memory.
igv-webapp-session.json - session with files in IGV Web (*.png are screenshots of the session).
How to run:
Preprocessing raw data to reduce size of files:
make
Running Python scripts:
zcat *.vcf.gz | python3 collect_freqs_select.py
or
zcat *.vcf.gz | pypy3 collect_freqs_select.py
python3 collect_freqs_bg.py
or
pypy3 collect_freqs_bg.py
Data was obtained from https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/downloads. Preprocessed
files with all the variants are still too big to sumbit.
